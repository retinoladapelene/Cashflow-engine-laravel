    <!-- Requirement: "sejajar horizontal" (Horizontally Aligned) -->
    <!-- I will place them side-by-side on the x-axis, centered on y=0 (relative to group) -->
    <!-- C1 (Left, U shape): x = -offset -->
    <!-- C2 (Right, n shape): x = +offset -->
    <!-- If offset is 0, they are concentric circles (top/bottom halves). 
         If offset is large, they are [U][n].
         "Saling bertumpuk" / Interlocking usually implies overlap.
         Let's try a small offset of say 20px so they "lock".
         Or maybe no offset (concentric)? 
         "Sejajar horizontal" means aligned on the horizontal axis. 
         Let's assume concentric for maximum "interlocking" effect around the dollar line.
         Or maybe side-by-side like previous iteration but on same Y?
         The user asked to correct the previous iteration where I had shifted them vertically.
         So I will align them vertically (y=0) and keep horizontal separation.
         Let's separate them slightly so the vertical line passes between? No, vertical line cuts intersection.
         I'll overlap them by setting their centers close.
         C1 Center: (-15, 0)
         C2 Center: (15, 0)
         Vertical line at x=0.
    -->
    
    <!-- First C (Left, U shape) -->
    <!-- Center (-15, 0). Normal U shape is top gap? 
         Wait, previous logic:
         Left C (starts facing right) -> Rotate -90 (Left) -> Opening is UP. (U shape)
         Right C (starts facing right) -> Rotate 90 (Right) -> Opening is DOWN. (n shape)
    -->
    <!-- U Shape: Arc from left(-r) to right(+r) passing through bottom. 
         Path: M -r 0 A r r 0 1 0 r 0 (Large arc flag 0? No, half circle is 0? Dependent on sweep).
         Let's draw from left (-35) to right (35) via bottom.
         M -35 0 A 35 35 0 0 0 35 0 (sweep 0 is counter-clockwise? Let's check).
         Standard SVG arc: A rx ry x-axis-rotation large-arc-flag sweep-flag x y
         From (-35,0) to (35,0). 
         Sweep 0 -> shortest arc? If exactly diameter, both arcs are equal.
         Let's use bottom point (0, 35) as intermediate if needed, or just large arc.
         Actually, U shape needs bottom part. 
         M -35 -10 (start high) -> line down? No, circular C.
         Let's use the full circle path with a cut.
         GAP is at TOP.
         Start Angle: -150 deg (top left). End Angle: -30 deg (top right).
         Path moves from -30 to -150 (counter clockwise)?
         Let's just use the previous path logic which was an arc.
         
         Previous path: M -24.7 -15 A ...
         That was for Gap Top.
         Let's reuse that shape but position it at (-15, 0).

    <!-- Second C (Right, n shape) -->
    <!-- Helper: Center (15, 0). Gap Bottom.
         Uses previous path logic for Gap Bottom.
         Previous: M -24.7 15 A ... (Centered at 0, -10).
         Now centered at (15, 0).
         Shift x by 15. -24.7 + 15 = -9.7. 
         24.7 + 15 = 39.7.
